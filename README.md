# crypto-craig

## Fetches prices of all coins from CoinMarketCap, spits to discord channel(s) of your choosing.

Backlog:
1. Create bot(s) to display price(s) of tokens in their name(s)
2. Add additional financial parameters for users to query (52-week highs/lows, market cap, etc)
3. Display neat & fancy graphs on user commands
